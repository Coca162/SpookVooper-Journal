    "Content": "SUMMARY OF THIS ACT\nThis Act shall give New Yam citizen the right to vote on bills for themselves and the senate without the need of a senator\n\n1. Empowering the People\n1. The current Senator of New Yam vows to give the people of New Yam the power to pass legislation for their own district\n   1. However if the bill cannot be functionally possible to implement or conflicts with senate laws or the constitution it cannot become New Yam law\n      1. It will be up to the senator to decide wherever or not this is true but if the people of New Yam do not thing the senator was unbiased in this choice they can sue them over if the bill actually did or did not\n   2. The Senator of New Yam can veto legislation but it should only be done when in extreme scenarios like corruption or the bill threatening to harm some the citizen of New Yam (for example if a large extremist group were to arise and try to create a bill that would harm beets the senator would be able to veto the bill)\n\n\n2. Senate Law\n1. The People of New Yam have the right to as well vote for Senate laws that the Senator of New Yam will propose for them\n1. Due to the Senator of New Yam requiring his or her bills which are proposed to be to a high standard they retain the right to veto the bill for whatever reason but this should be discouraged by citizen if there is no follow up from the senator like improving the bill and then proposing it\n\n\n3. Voting\n2. Voting will preferably be done in the #New-Yam chat or wherever is the most convenient way for the people of New Yam\n   1. If a server is established for New Yam it will still be preferred for voting to be in the #New-Yam chat\n      1. It would only be recommended to have voting in a New Yam Discord server if there is people (or everyone) who are able to verify no votes were not manipulated "
